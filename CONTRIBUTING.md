# Contributing

So, you want to contribute to this project! That's awesome. However, before doing so, 
please read the following simple steps how to contribute.

## CHANGELOG

Add all noticable changes to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
To provide a unified view to the changes please format the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) as done [in this example](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 

## Discuss the changes before doing them

There is a [edison-microservice Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edison-microservice) where you 
can get help or open a discussion about missing features or other issues. 

You can also use the GitHub issue tracker, to [open an issue](https://github.com/otto-de/edison-microservice/issues), 
describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any other ideas you have. 
This will help us to get you started on the right foot.

It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps. However, if 
the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can continue and fix it.

## Fixing issues

Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix: some-great-feature or some-issue-fix.

Commit your changes in that branch, writing the code following the code style. Please do not forget to
add some tests and documentation

## Creating a pull request

Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request message (e.g. fixes #). 
Write a good description and title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

## Wait for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback about what should be 
fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing in your branch and the pull request will be 
updated automatically.

## Everyone is happy!

Finally, your contributions will be merged, and we will publish a new release. Contributions are more than welcome!

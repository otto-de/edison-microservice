# Release History

## release 0.80.0
* **[edison-service]** Make edison-service independent of other edison packages

## Release 0.61.0

  fix this.

## Release 0.52.1
* Refactored load indication (see 0.52.0) from edison-status to edison-metrics and introduced new endpoint `/internal/load` which returns the load status to be used by consumers (ie. auto-scaling drivers). See `example-metrics` for an usage example on average response time behaviour.

## Release 0.52.0
* Added status indicator allowing the application to signal overload (see `LoadStatusIndicator`), which enables ie. watchers to autoscale the application accordingly
* two default strategies to discover load, one making use of metrics library, allowing to leverage `@Timed` annotations on your classes  (see `application.properties` in `example-status`)

* Extended `JobService` to cover also synchronous job execution

## Release 0.49.2
* Fix error on job page for long-running jobs

## Release 0.46.1
* Minor refactorings in handling of job events.

## Release 0.46.0
* Rebuild job state architecture due to introduce an event bus to separate the JobInfo and the
  JobRepository. From now on the JobRunner and the specific jobs will report changes (states and messages) to
  an EventPublisher, which will propagate the events to the JobEventListeners (e.g. persist them or log them).
  You can register your own JobEventListeners. The JobMonitor is removed.
* If your job has an error, you should throw a RuntimeException with an errorMessage. Then the job will be retriggered (if retry configured).

## Release 0.45.2
* Minor bugfixes
* Using Guava CacheStats in CacheStatistics

* The factory methods of the `DefaultJobDefinition` now have an additional parameter for the number of restarts.
* Every `JobRunnable` now needs to provide a `JobDefinition`
* Removed `JobRunnable#getJobType`. The job type is accessed by the `JobDefinition`
* Renamed to `DefaultJobDefinition#notTriggerableJobDefinition` to `manuallyTriggerableJobDefinition` to clarify purpose
* Removed hystrix module

## Release 0.44.0

New Features:
* MongoDB persistence: Allow to retrieve the object (including key) when it is created.
  Changed signature of `create` and  `createOrUpdate` in `AbstractMongoRepository`
  to return the object instead of void

Bug Fixes:
* Allow also a value without key to be given to `AbstractMongoRepository#createOrUpdate` without throwing a NPE
* `application.properties`: renamed ``edison.application.name`` (introduced in Release 0.35.0) back into `spring.application.name`
  (see [ContextIdApplicationContextInitializer](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.3.0.RELEASE/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/context/ContextIdApplicationContextInitializer.java)
  for details on identifying your application)

* JobDefinitions extended to support jobs that are not triggered automatically.

## Release 0.37.0
* Fixed links on internal pages

## Release 0.35.0

New Features:
* New library servicediscovery-client introduced to provide basic ServiceDiscovery features for Edison Microservices.
This lib may be used to register services at an Edison JobTrigger.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed possible ConcurrentModificationException if job messages are accessed from JobInfo.

Breaking Changes:
* application.properties is now using server.context-path instead of server.contextPath.
* application.properties is now using edison.application.name instead of application.name.

New Features:
* Jobs are rendered with absolute URLs in JSON and HTML representations.
* Introduced the (optional) concept of JobDefinitions to describe the expected frequency etc. to trigger jobs.
* Based on the JobDefinitions, for every Job a StatusDetailIndicator is registered automatically. This may be
disabled by either not providing a JobDefinition, or by setting property edison.jobs.status.enabled=false

Breaking Changes:
* Jobs in earlier version where identified by the URI of the job including the servlet context path. Starting with
this version, the context path is not part of the identifier anymore. You should DELETE all old jobs, otherwise
the URLs a broken.
* Job representations now contain the full URL of the jobs instead of relative URIs.
